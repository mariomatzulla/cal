**Illustration 7: Typical Calendar Base Page Tree Setup**

The Calendar Base extension can reside on an existing page or you can create dedicated pages and sub-pages for it. Although the extension has been designed to operate effectively on a single page, you can choose to dedicate additional pages for specific views. See Illustration 7 for an example Page Tree with a multiple-page Calendar Base extension setup.

Ultimately, if you will be using the Advanced Search Options, you will need to create a separate Search page.
