Step 1: Install the Extension
==============================

.. include:: ../../Includes.txt

The Calendar Base extension can be installed through the typical TYPO3 installation process using the Extension Manager.

During the installation process, you may be invited to install additional suggested extensions that interact with the Calendar Base. These are all simply suggestions and can safely be ignored if you choose.

|img-4| **Note**:If you plan to use the Address List extension (tt\_address), then you must install that extension *before* installing the Calendar Base extension. You do not have to use the extension if you install it now,
so if you do not plan on using the extension at this time, but may want to at some future date, you should go ahead and install it before continuing.
