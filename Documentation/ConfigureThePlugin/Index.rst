Once you have completed the installation process, the next step is to configure the Calendar Base's plugin. The plugin controls what views are displayed in the Frontend as well as offering some additional options.

#. Refer to Illustration 8. If you haven't done so already, give the plugin a  **Header** title ( **1** ).

#. If you don't want the Header to be displayed in the Frontend, select **Hidden** from the  **Type** drop-down list ( **2** ).

#. In the **Startingpoint** field, select the Storage Folder where you will keep your Calendar Records ( **3** ). This is most likely either the Storage Folder you created in Step 2 of the Installation, or your site's General Storage Page.

#. As shown in Illustration 9, there are nine tabs in the Calendar Base Plugin. Use the following illustrations and descriptions to configure the plugin as desired.

Be sure to save the Flexform when you have finished configuring the plugin.
