**Illustration 16: Plugin Configuration: Other View Tab**

|img-5| These options are only available with the "classic" typoscript template (see :ref:`Step5AddTheStaticTemplates`).

Refer to Illustration 16. The Other View tab is similar to the General Settings tab in that it sets options that are shared across multiple views.
- **Show login:** Shows an instance of the Frontend User Login in the default Week and Day Views.

- **Show search:** Shows an instance of the search engine that has been limited to searching Calendar Base records. See :ref:`AddingASearchOption` for more details.

- **Show jumps:** Shows a Jump menu for Frontend navigation. Allows users to quickly “jump” to other weeks, months, or years.

- **Show category selector:** Displays a check-box to the left of categories displayed in the Legend. By enabling or disabling the category check- boxes, Frontend users can choose to display or hide events associated with specific categories.

- **Show tomorrows events:** Displays a title list of the next-day's events in the default Week and Day Views.
