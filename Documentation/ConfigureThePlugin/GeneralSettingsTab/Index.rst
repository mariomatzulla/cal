**Illustration 9: Plugin Configuration: General Tab**

The General Settings tab sets the available views and a variety of general options that are shared across the views.
- **Allowed views:** Determines which views will be available in the Frontend. The first view in the Selected field will be treated as the default view. There are many different items you can add to your calendar. Each will be explained in their related section of this manual.

- **Calendar name:** The name of the calendar. This will be the Header displayed throughout the views. This field is optional.

- **Allow to subscribe:** Allows anonymous Frontend users to subscribe to an event so that they are notified of any changes to the event. It is recommended, however, that the Captcha Library extension be installed to ensure only legitimate users are able to subscribe (see :ref:`TheCaptchaLibrary`).

- **Allow FE user to subscribe:** Allows registered Frontend users to subscribe to an event so that they are notified of any changes to the event.

- **Week start day:** Choose which day of the week you want to start with in your calendar display. Choices include a traditional Sunday start day or a business Monday start day.

- **Distance (Km) for events in a nearby calendar:** Option when :ref:`WecMaps` is loaded. Defines the distance of an event and a frontend user.
