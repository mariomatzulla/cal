**Illustration 12: Plugin Configuration: Day View Tab**

Refer to Illustration 12.
- **Day view page:** Used only if you've specified an additional page for the Day View (see :ref:`YearMonthWeekViewTabs`).

- **Day start time (hhmm):** Determines the first hour that will be displayed in the Day View. Events scheduled before the specified times will not be displayed in this view.Use the 24-hour clock to specify AM or PM times.

- **Day endtime (hhmm):** The latest start time for displaying a scheduled event. Events scheduled after this specified time will not be displayed in the this view. Use the 24-hour clock to specify AM or PM times.

|img-3| Tip: The 24-hour clock begins with 0000 hours (midnight) and
ends with 2359 (11:59 PM) or 2400 (midnight). To easily calculate the
time of an evening meeting, simply add 12 to the hour, thus 6:30 PM is
6+12=18 and would be rendered 1830.

- Show divider every x minutes: Determines how the Day View divides the displayed hours. Options include 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 minutes intervals.
