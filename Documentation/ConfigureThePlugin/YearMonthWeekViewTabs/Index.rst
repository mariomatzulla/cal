**Illustration 11: Plugin Configuration: Year View Tab**

Refer to Illustration 11. The Year, Month, and Week View Tabs only have a single options field. For most default installations with a lone Calendar page, you may leave this field blank. However, if you have created multiple pages for your calendar's views, you will need to choose the page for each view using the  **Browse for Records** icon ( **1** ).
