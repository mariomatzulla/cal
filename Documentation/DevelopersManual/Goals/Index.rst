The Calendar Base extension is designed to be a flexible framework
that other extensions can plug into to display calendar data in a
common format and location, without in any way limiting the
functionality available for these extensions. To this end, the overall
architecture relies heavily on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
to separate the layout from the data and on TYPO3 Services to provide
pluggable models and views.
