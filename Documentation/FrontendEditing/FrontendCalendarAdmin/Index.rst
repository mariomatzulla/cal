**Illustration 41: Frontend Administration**

As you have seen in the above Enabling Frontend Editing section, authorized Frontend users can do more than just create and edit events. The additional options for creating, editing, and deleting calendars, categories, locations, and organizers are available there (if enabled in the Calendar Base plugin). Clicking on one of the Create links or selecting one of the drop-down menus (see Illustration 41) will take you to an appropriate form to make whatever changes you desire.
