One of the features the Calendar Base extension offers is the ability to add, edit, and delete calendar, calendar event records, categories, etc. from the Frontend. There are two levels of editors for Frontend users: Basic Frontend Calendar Editors typically have the ability to create, edit, and delete Calendar Event records; Calendar Administrators typically have the ability to create, edit, and delete all associated Calendar Base records. However, you can limit the rights to either Basic or Administrators through the choices made in the Calendar Base's plugin (General Tab). Basic Calendar editing is enabled by assigning the function to users in Website Users records and Frontend User Group records (typically found in the Website's General Storage Folder). Frontend Calendar Administration is enabled in the Constant Editor General option (see :ref:`CalendarBaseGeneralConstantEditorForm`).

When a registered and authorized Calendar Editor is logged in, the Frontend displays a variety of icons to facilitate editing. (See Illustration 39.) Basic Calendar Editors will not see the Frontend Calendar Admin Link in their views.
