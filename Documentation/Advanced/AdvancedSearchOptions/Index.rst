You can create an Advanced Search page that will allow users to search
not only events, but locations and organizers as well. The Advanced
Search page should be separate from the main calendar page and must
have its own plugin installed. The following steps will get it set up.

#. Create a new page for the Advanced Search. We recommend that you
   create it as a sub-page of your main calendar page.

#. Install the Calendar Base plugin on the page.

#. In the General Settings Tab, select Search All, Organizer, and
   Location.  ***Search All MUST be the first item*** in the list and
   will nullify any other subordinate views.

#. In the General Settings Tab, select the Starting Point where your
   Calendar records are stored.

#. In the Other View Tab, select the Show Search check-box.

#. Create a link on your main calendar page to your Advanced Search page.

That's it.
