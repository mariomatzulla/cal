Using Multiple Calendars
=========================

One of the best Calendar Base features is the ability to use multiple
calendar records on a single page. This allows you to limit which
events appear on the calendar based on the Frontend user's
registration and login. For instance, you may want to limit staff
events, etc.

#. Create a new Calendar record (see :ref:`CreateACalendarRecord` for a refresher if
   needed). Choose an “owner” for the record, either a Frontend User
   Group or you can select individuals from the Frontend Users.

#. Create new Event Records (or edit older ones as needed), associating
   them with the new Calendar record (see :ref:`CreateCalendarEvents` for a refresher if
   needed).

That's it. When a registered and logged-in “owner” views the Calendar
page, events associated with their Calendar record, their events will
be shown.
