#. Follow the directions and upload the file into the ext-templates sub-
   directory. Your modified template should now be uploaded to the
   location you chose. In our example here, the path to that location is:
   **fileadmin/ext-templates/TemplateName.tmpl**

#. Refer to Illustration 55. Click the  **Template** module ( **4** ), and click the page where your Calendar Base plugin is configured ( **5** ).

   right corner of the page ( **6** ), and chose Calendar Base
   (Templates) from the  **Category:** drop down list ( **7** ).

#. Scroll down the page to find the template you've modified and put a
   check in the corresponding check box ( **8** ).

#. Scroll back up and click  **Update** ( **9** ) to enable the text
   input box.

#. In the text input box, insert the path of your modified template (in
   our example, it would be  **fileadmin/ext-
   templates/YourTemplateName.tmpl** ). Scroll back up and click the
   **Update** button once again.

Do the same for any or all the templates you wish to modify.
