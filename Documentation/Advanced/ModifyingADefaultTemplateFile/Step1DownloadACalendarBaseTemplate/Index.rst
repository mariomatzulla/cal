The Calendar Base template files are tucked away in the deep recesses
of TYPO3. To download a Calendar Base template:

#. Navigate to your TYPO3 installation and the folder: typo3conf/ext/cal/standard_templates
#. Choose a template file.
#. Save the file onto your local computer. You may change the name of the file if you'd like; however, the extension  **.tmpl** should not be changed.
