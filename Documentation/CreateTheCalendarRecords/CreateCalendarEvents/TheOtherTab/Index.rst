**Illustration 26: Calendar Event: Other Tab**

Refer to Illustration 26.
- **Monitoring Users:** If Frontend users have subscribed to events, their usernames will appear here. In addition, if you wish to subscribe particular users to the event, you can manually select them from existing users in the General Storage Folder.

- **Share this event with another user:** If you have allowed Groups of Registered Frontend users to edit events (see the :ref:`TypoScriptReferenceSetup` section), you can allow individual registered users from other groups to edit this event if you desire by adding their Website user name here.

|img-4| **Note**: Frontend editing (in the :ref:`ConstantEditor`) must be enabled for this option to function.
