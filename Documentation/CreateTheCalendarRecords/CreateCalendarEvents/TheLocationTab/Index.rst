The Location Tab works either independently or in conjunction with the :ref:`LocationsRecord`. By creating
Location records, you are presented with the option of using the WEC Map extension that will generate a Google Map complete with directions for the location.

**Illustration 23: The Calendar Event: Location Tab**

Refer to Illustration 23.
- **Location, or...:** This is the title of the location that will be displayed if you have not created a Location record and chosen it in the Cal Location drop-down menu below. This option can be turned off in the Configuration form (See :ref:`CalendarBaseConfiguration`).

- **Cal Location, or...:** These options are generated from :ref:`LocationsRecord` that you create. If left at None, the displayed location will be generated from the Location field above. If you make a selection here, it will override the above Location field.

- **Page to link the location to:** If you have a page that has a map, directions, or other information on it about the location, you can link to it here. This link will override the Cal Location field and create a link from the Location field.
