Deviation Events are generally used in conjunction with Recurring Events. Deviation Events are Events that differ from recurring schedule – either by time, by title, location, organizer - whatever. For instance, one event from a weekly scheduled event needs to move to another location.

**Illustration 29: Deviation Event Record**

Refer to Illustration 29.
- **Original Start Date:** The date when the original recurring event would take place.

- **Original Start Time:** The time when the original recurring event would start. *Please leave this field empty if you want to set a deviation to a “allday” event. In any other case, this time must match exactly.*

- **Deviation Event Title / any other field:** Please refer to the basic event fields. Setting a value for a deviation event means to override the corresponding filed of the original record.

|img-4| **NOTE:** Edit Deviation Events only from the original Recurring Event record, *not* directly in backend list view.
