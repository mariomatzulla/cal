New recurrence model enabled by default
========================================

.. include:: ../../Includes.txt

With Calendar Base 1.4, the new recurrence model is enabled by default. This helps improve performance and reduces memory
consumption.

Please refer to the ":ref:`Installation`" chapter, ":ref:`Step3CreateAndConfigureRecordStorageFolder`" and to ":ref:`calIndexer`" to learn more about the required configuration for automated recurrence index updates and the usage of the indexer.

|img-5| If you already have recurring events, you need to execute the indexer at least one time to initialize the recurrence index.
