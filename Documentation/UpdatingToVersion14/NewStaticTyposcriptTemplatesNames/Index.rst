New static TypoScript templates & names

Calendar Base 1.4 comes with new templates (see the chapter “:ref:`TemplateFilesAndMarkers`”). To deliver these with a better naming, the template names have changed.

After installing version 1.4, you will have the option to update your existing TypoScript template records and include the desired Calendar Base templates (the old one from version 1.3 is “classic” and the new one is “standard”).

Please be aware that the classic template will become deprecated in the future. This step also might also be required for some Calendar Base 1.4-dev installations.

|img-5| The functions that have a checkbox in the plugin's “:ref:`OtherViewTab`” flexform tab are not implemented in the newly introduced “standard templates” yet.
