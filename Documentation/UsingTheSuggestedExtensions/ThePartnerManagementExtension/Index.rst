The Partner Management Extension

.. include:: ../../Includes.txt

The Partner Management extension is a powerful extension that allows you to build a relational database between people and between organizations. The extension can be used to create or link Location and Organizer records in the Calendar Base extension. It is beyond the scope of this manual to fully explain this extension. If you choose to install and utilize the extension, you will need to change the Calendar Base Configuration in the Extension Manager Module similarly
to the Address List extension, choosing Partner Framework in the drop-down menus.

The Partner Management extension comes with a complete manual that outlines how to create Partnership records and how to operate the extension to its fullest capacity.
