**Illustration 38: WEC Maps Extension in Action**

The WEC Maps extension works with the Google Maps API to display a Google map whenever a mapped location is selected. Install the extension like any other extension. You will need to consult the extension's manual for instructions on setting up the plugin, including obtaining a Google Maps API Key. Once you have configured the extension, when you create either Location or Organizer records, the WEC Maps extension will Geocode the coordinates and provide a map for Frontend users (see Illustration 38).
