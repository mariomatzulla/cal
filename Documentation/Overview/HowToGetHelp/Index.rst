The TYPO3 Calendar Project newsgroup at news://lists.typo3.org/typo3.projects.calendar is the best place to get support for any Calendar Base questions. Post your questions and another user or someone from the development team will probably be able to help you out.

Apart from the newsgroup, please visit our project page at forge `(http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cal)
<http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cal>`_ and use the search function there. If you think you found a bug in an official release, need a new feature (or want to sponsor one) this is the best place to give it visibility.

In any case, please provide some basic information of your installation: Which Typo3 version do you use, which cal version, what kind of TS template (“classic” or “standard”) and what recurrence model is used.
