				There are three types of calendars:
				&lt;b&gt;Standard&lt;/b&gt;: The Standard Calendar (database) is the default record. It depends on manual entry to generate Calendar Event records.
				&lt;b&gt;Include ICS File&lt;/b&gt;: The Include ICS File Calendar allows you to upload an .ics file for the creation of Calendar Event records. The Include ICS File Calendar's form is identical to the Standard Calendar's form, with the exception that it provides a field for uploading or attaching a previously uploaded file.
				NOTE: Desktop applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Apple iCal are able to export ICS files, which can then be uploaded for use with Calendar Base.
				&lt;b&gt;External Calendar&lt;/b&gt;: The External Calendar depends on an ICS feed for the creation of Calendar Event records. The External Calendar's form is identical to the Standard Calendar's form, with the exception that it provides a field for the URL of a web-based ICS calendar feed.
				NOTE: Google, Yahoo, and others provide online calendars that allow exports of their data. Look for links about &quot;sharing your calendar.&quot; You will need the provided URL - look for their ICS or iCal URLs. They will be files with an .ics extension.
